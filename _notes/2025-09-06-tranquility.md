For some time, I find it difficult not to grow irritated by others' behavior, especially when it seems unfair in relation to me. These are subtle, self-inflicted annoyances, and I do not carry them onto my next day. Still, I dislike the unrest of that particular day, or even of a single hour.

Some time ago, inspired by Franklin's autobiography, I replaced my habit goals with virtues. For instance, the habits of *avoid sugar* and *sleep well* both fall under the virtue of *moderation*, and indeed, it makes little sense to aim for one habit while neglecting the other. Hence, I strip away the burden of habits by focusing on a virtue of choice for one week. The practice of *tranquility* cures my heart of disappointment and mild sadness.
