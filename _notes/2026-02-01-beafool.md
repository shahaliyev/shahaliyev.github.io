**Beafool Feb 14, 2020**

There are things in life worth striving for. For example, it would be nice to believe in your own incomparable uniqueness without getting narcissistic. Or be capable of living life at ease: as an old man who doesn't mind to look stupid.

How does one escape the idiotism of teenagehood? I don't know. I couldn't achieve that. But I sometimes tried to put myself in the shoes of an old man who is wise enough to be dumb.

In my eyes, there have always been something off with serious old men. It is usually adults and young people who are self-conscious, serious, and bothered by things of tiny matter. And if a person still keeps such seriousness about life when he is old, and wisdom hasn't turned him into a child, then he is not wise enough in the first place. And I cannot admire much the life of an unwise old man.

But even if I know that I should not be bothered by many things, I am weak enough to resist my bother. I just hope that I am not damned to be an idiot during my whole adulthood, so that I can get less serious, and more foolish and funny.
