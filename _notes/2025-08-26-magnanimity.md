What if, each day, I tackled a single virtue or vice and observed it in my own behavior. That would be a day worth spent.

I search online for a translation of Aristotelian Ethics. Finding a good translator and classicist is half the job done. [W.D. Ross.](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html) I need book iv, chapter iii, the term I look for is *magnanimity.*

The translation is old-fashioned. The ancient Greek word *megalopsychia (μεγαλοψυχία)* is translated as *pride* – denoting the noble pride of a man conscious of his true worth. It is flanked by two mistakes: vanity (claiming more than one deserves) and undue humility (claiming less). Vain people, not being worthy, adorn themselves with clothing and outward show. Undue humility, however, is both commoner and worse, as it blocks one's path toward desiring great things and acting nobly.

Magnanimity is a mean, not in size, but in accuracy. One must look back and list down his achievements and responsibilities, and claim them without inflation or minimization. One must look around and notice who is honoring him and for what. Recognition from the competent for substantial deeds is to be valued, applause for trifles is to be ignored.

The magnanimous man has proportional courage: he avoids trivial dangers, but does not shrink from great ones when the cause is worthy. There is asymmetry in his generosity – he confers benefits, ashamed of receiving them. He remembers what he has given, not to boast or to remind others of favors owed, but to value himself correctly. He is just, yet forgetful of wrongs, as slights cannot diminish him. He aims at few but great honors, not at minor or common deeds. He is open in hate and love, expressing truth without servility. He never praises himself, nor he speaks ill of another person.
