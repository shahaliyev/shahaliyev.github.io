**Thinking Globally | Feb 7, 2020**

Recently, I came across the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis). It made me look at the Earth as a superorganism and not only: humans were a part of a bigger system; our planet, galaxy, and cosmos were parts of bigger systems, ordered in an hierarchical manner, serving for no purpose or for one purpose only: to destroy herself and rise up again from her own ashes.

Everything moves in cycles of death and rebirth. Even the most powerful civilizations collapse for the other ones to emerge, humans die and born, planets explode, disappear, and new planets get formed from space dust. With this logic, the cosmos may disappear at one point, too, only to give herself a rebirth from yet another big bang (or whatever).

The mother Earth kills her sons and gives birth to her new children. The mother cosmos does the same. Hence the [Medea hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_hypothesis) is not anti-Gaian. Both hypotheses are different sides of the same coin – the coin of death and rebirth.
