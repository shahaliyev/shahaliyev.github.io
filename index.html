               I am an Instructor of Computer and Information Sciences department at the <a href="https://ada.edu.az/">ADA University</a>, where I got my bachelor's and master's degrees. My master's degree was also a dual degree program offered by the <a href="https://www.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a>.

               I am an <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/13406388">International Chess Master</a> with a Grandmaster norm (2019). I became the chess champion of Azerbaijan four times, in Under-12, Under-14, and Under-16 age categories (two years in a row). I also became the U-13 World School Chess Championship silver medalist in Iasi, Romania. My latest championship was in Nakhchivan Open 2022.
