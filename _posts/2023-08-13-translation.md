title: Problem with Azerbaijani Translations
---

{% info %}
I usually avoid reading translations into Azerbaijani language. The main problem is that the books are often translated not directly from their original tongue, but from their Russian language translations. Below is one specific example (out of possible many) excerpted from my earlier essay, demonstrating one issue (out of possible many) with such "second-hand" translations.

There is no easy translation of the word _честолюбие_ even to english. It is translated as _ambition_ as far as I know, when the synonym/analogue _амбиция_ has a subtle shade in Russian languge. Yet let's try to translate the word _честолюбие_ into Azerbaijani. Isn't it _şöhrətpərəstlik_, as noted in [online vocabularies](https://obastan.com/%D0%A7%D0%95%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%9E%D0%9B%D0%AE%D0%91%D0%98%D0%95/874951/?l=az)? But then тщеславие (vanity) is [also](https://obastan.com/%D1%82%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B5/99852/?l=az) _şöhrətpərəstlik._

I opened up Stendhal's _The Red and Black_ in three different languages &ndash; in Azerbaijani, Russian, and English. Following is the translation of two important nouns to describe the commonly encountered traits of human character.

> vanity, тщеславие, şöhrətpərəstlik

> ambition, честолюбие, izzəti-nəfs 

I searched it in [vocabulary](https://obastan.com/izz%C9%99ti-n%C9%99fs/20228/): the arabic word _izzəti-nəfs_ has a closer meaning to the word _dignity_ than to _ambition_. Perhaps, the translator was in a rush, and translated the word _честолюбие_ literally &ndash; as _love of honor (izzəti-nəfs)_ by considering the combination of both words: _честь (honor)_ and _любовь (love)_. 

From here, I also arrive at another ridiculous conclusion: the word _ambition_ in French is... _ambition_. Hence the translation wasn't even directly from the original language of the book. Would the translation happen from the French language, there would be no confusion about the tricky word of _честолюбие_. That is the work of a popular and well-respected publication house in Azerbaijan. 

I still don't know if there is a translation of the word _ambition_ into Azerbaijani or not. For now, we will borrow it from its latin origin: _ambisiya_.
