## Week 1: May 14-20

I noted ten-ish goals in [My Goals for 2024](/writings/goals-2024). I now discard them. Tonight, I replace ethical life with aesthetic one. I don't know what that means.

What matters? People, health, impulses of soul (if you are above 22).

It is 1:36 am. After five hours, I will be running. That comes not from the impulses of soul. I should be running every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 5:50 am.

I should publish a book by the end of this year or I will be doomed to remain outside of literary circles and fame for the rest of my life. I replace reading books with writing.

I will learn to live with passion. I should learn to observe and listen to people and my soul very carefully. Everything else is futile. People and soul is not.
